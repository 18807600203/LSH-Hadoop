Open projects:
	Solr:
		SolrReprocessor:
			Read all records from a Solr and add all of the neighbors
			to each document.
				
	LSH base:
		Unit hasher- 
		Geohash data format
			Use Geohash as the earth hasher?
			Do rotated Geohash to make things easier?
			Need to do spherical mapping even if rotated.
		LOD 
			datastructure?
			add to formats
	
		
Needed for Solr upload:
	clean LSH
	explanation!
	store grid space in documents?
	SolrReprocessor
	Sample data

Needed for Mahout upload:
	Mahout data management
	Examples with large datasets.
	Need reshuffle of recommendation engine data
	into very large set of dimensions,
	then hash all dimensions and give very very fast 
	recommendations.
	One way is to implement Semantic Vectors 
	(one-way influence of two randomly-projected vectors).
	Would be a good intro to Mahout!
	
	LOD management:
	Have M/R algorithms laid out for limitation rules:
		"No neighbors beyond X"
		"At least N neighbors"
		"No more than N neighbors"
	They are iterative passes to expand or collapse
	1 LOD. Top-down "expands" a simplex into next LOD down.
	Bottom-up "collapses" 4 simplexes into one larger simplex.
	Each rule requires up to #LOD steps.
	These rules can be done in sequence.
	
	
Demo:
	Have done four real-world sets:
		US zip code -> SVG output. Looked rather weird.

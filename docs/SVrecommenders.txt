Semantic Vectors for Recommenders:

Given the overlapping universes of users and items, create a matrix where users are rows and items are columns. The value in each position of the matrix is the (overlaid cross-universe) distance between that user and that item.

   I   I   I
U 0.3     0.6
U     0.1 0.2


A note on interpretation: these values encode the relative strength of user U's preference for item I. The numbers are unitless. I am not sure whether a value of 0.6 means "twice as strong" as 0.3 in a linear, logarythmic or gaussian distribution.

Now, let's make a separate universe pair. Since the GroupLens movie rating data also includes the date/time of when the user recorded the rating, we will make a third parallel universe of days of the week. This time, the item universe exerts gravity on the D-O-W universe. With the three items above, the resulting matrix is:

   S   M   T    W   T   F   S
I 0.1     0.5  0.2     0.7
I     0.2      0.4         0.1
I     0.6 0.4      0.9

These values encode the relative number of ratings that occured for item I on day X.


Let's multiply these two matrices:
  I  I   I         SMTWTFS            SMTWTFS
U               * I           =>     U
U                 I                  U
                  I

The resulting User v.s. Day-Of-Week gives the relative frequency of user X making a rating on a particular day of whe week.
